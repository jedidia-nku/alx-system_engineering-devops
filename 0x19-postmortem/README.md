Issue Summary
    1.Duration: The outage lasted from May 4, 2024, 14:00 UTC to May 4, 2024, 16:30 UTC.
    
    2.Impact: A significant slowdown and eventual unavailability of our e-commerce platform, affecting approximately 68% of our users during peak hours. Users experienced timeouts and slow loading times which prevented order completion.
    
    3.Root Cause: A sudden spike in traffic due to a promotional campaign led to an overload of the database servers, which were not scaled to handle such load.

Timeline
    1. 14:05 UTC: Increase in traffic detected by monitoring tools.

    2. 14:15 UTC: Alerts received about slow database responses.
    
    3. 14:25 UTC: Incident escalated to the database management team.
    
    4. 14:40 UTC: Initial mitigation steps taken, including query optimization and increasing read replica counts.
    
    5. 15:20 UTC: Attempts made to redirect some of the traffic to secondary databases proved partially effective but did not resolve the issue.
    
    6. 15:45 UTC: Decision made to add additional database resources.
    
    7. 16:00 UTC: Deployment of additional database instances completed.
    
    8. 16:20 UTC: Service restoration began as database performance stabilized.
    
    9.16:30 UTC: Full service restoration confirmed, monitoring continued for stability.

Root Cause and Resolution
    1. Cause: The database was unable to handle an unexpected surge in read and write operations, which was triggered by a highly successful marketing campaign. The existing autoscaling settings for the database were insufficient to cope with the load increase.

    2. Resolution: Immediate action was taken to optimize active queries and increase the number of read replicas to distribute the load. In the medium term, we improved the autoscaling algorithms and increased the baseline capacity of our database servers to handle sudden spikes in traffic.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent future incidents of this nature, the following steps have been identified:

    1. Review and Enhance Scaling Policies: Adjust autoscaling triggers and limits for database resources based on new traffic patterns and predictions.

    2. Capacity Planning: Conduct a thorough review of current capacity and perform stress testing on our infrastructure to identify other potential bottlenecks.

    3. Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring tools to provide earlier warnings of unusual spikes in load or performance degradation.

    4. Database Optimization: Schedule regular reviews of database performance and query optimization to ensure efficient handling of requests.

    5. Staff Training: Increase training for the engineering team on emergency response and rapid scaling techniques.

By implementing these measures, we aim to increase our resilience against unforeseen surges in demand and ensure high availability and performance for our users.
